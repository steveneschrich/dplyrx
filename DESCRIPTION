Description: There are a few extra things that are dplyr-like that I have found useful. One 
  is the ability to coalesce columns after joining but warning if there are mismatches (and not
  coalescing). Another is to join across a list of tables, cleaning up collisions (same columns)
  afterwards. This package implements that functionality.
